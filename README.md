Lenovo Legion Toolkit (LLT) is a utility created for Lenovo Legion laptops, that allows changing a couple of features that are only available in Lenovo Vantage or Legion Zone.

**If your laptop is not part of Legion or Ideapad Gaming lines, this software is not for you. Please do NOT open compatibility requests for other devices. Issues will be closed and not looked at!**

It runs no background services, uses less memory, uses virtually no CPU, and contains no telemetry. Just like Lenovo Vantage, this application is Windows only.

## Disclaimer

**The tool comes with no warranty. Use at your own risk.**

This is a hobby project. I want to make it available on more devices, but it will take some time, so please be patient and read through this readme carefully.

## Donate

If you enjoy using the Lenovo Legion Toolkit, consider donating.

## Download

You can download the installer from the Releases page here: [Latest release](https://github.com/BartoszCichecki/LenovoLegionToolkit/releases/latest).

## Compatibility

Lenovo Legion Toolkit is compatible with a lot of Lenovo Legion and Ideapad Gaming laptops from 2020, 2021 and 2022 running Windows 10 and 11.

Overall the recommendation is to disable or uninstall Vantage, Hotkeys and Legion Zone while using LLT. There are some functions that cause conflicts or may not work properly when LLT is working along side other Lenovo apps.

If you are getting an incompatible message on startup, you can check the *Contribution* section down at the bottom, to see how can you help. Keep in mind, that not always I can make all options compatible with all hardware since I do not have access to it.

The list of supported models can be found here: [Compatibility.cs](https://github.com/BartoszCichecki/LenovoLegionToolkit/blob/master/LenovoLegionToolkit.Lib/Utils/Compatibility.cs).

**Support for other laptop that are not part of Legion or Ideapad Gaming lines is not planned.**

## Features

The app allows to:

- Change settings like power mode, battery charging mode, etc. that are available only through Vantage.
- Access to Custom Mode available only in Legion Zone, including Fan Control on 2022 models.
- 4-zone RGB and White backlight keyboards support.
- Change display refresh rate (built-in display only).
- Deactivate discrete GPU (nVidia only).
- View battery statistics.
- Download software updates.
- Define Actions that will run when the laptop is i.e. connected to AC power.
- Disable/enable Lenovo Vantage, Legion Zone and Lenovo Hotkeys service without uninstalling it.

##### Custom Mode

Custom Mode is supported on following BIOS versions:
* GKCN49WW and higher
* H1CN49WW and higher
* HACN31WW and higher
* HHCN23WW and higher
* K1CN31WW and higher
* J2CN40WW and higher
* JUCN51WW and higher
* JYCN39WW and higher

Not all features of Custom Mode are supported by all devices.

##### Deactivate discrete GPU

Sometimes discrete GPU stays active even when it should not. This can happen for example, if you work with an external screen and you disconnect it - some processes will keep running on discrete GPU keeping it alive and shortening battery life.

There are two ways to help the GPU deactivate:

1. killing all processes running on dGPU (this one seems to work better),
2. disabling dGPU for a short amount of time, which will force all processes to move to the integrated GPU.

Deactivate button will be enabled when dGPU is active, you have Hybrid mode enabled and there are no screens connected to dGPU. If you hover over the button, you will see the current P state of dGPU and the list of processes running on it.

Keep in mind that some apps may not like this feature and crash when you deactivate dGPU.

##### Windows Power Plans

Lenovo Legion Toolkit will automatically switch Windows power plans when Power Mode changes *and* when Lenovo Vantage is disabled.

On some laptops though, Lenovo Vantage never switched power plans. If you have one of the laptops where Lenovo Vantage does not change Windows power plans automatically you can override this behavior in Settings. This will allow Toolkit to always change Windows power plans, even if Lenovo Vantage is running in the background.

##### CPU Boost Modes

This allows modifying the hidden setting of Windows Power Plans called *Processor performance boost mode*. It is a little bit cryptic what these options do, but the best explanation is provided here:

## FAQ

#### Why doesn't LLT launch on startup even though Autorun option is enabled?

LLT is started using Task Scheduler, so that it can launch with admin rights. Startup is delayed by 1 minutes (30 seconds in version 2.4.0 and up) to allow other components to start and be ready to use. If you don't see LLT in tray after a ~minute after seeing your desktop, create an issue.

#### My motherboard was replaced and now LLT gives me incompatible message. What do I do?

Sometimes new motherboard does not contain correct model numbers and serial numbers. You should try [this tutorial](https://laptopwiki.eu/index.php/guides-and-tutorials/important-bios-related-guides/recover-original-model-sku-values/) to try and recover them. If that method does not succeed, you can workaround by going to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\LenovoLegionToolkit` and creating an `args.txt` file. Inside that file paste `--skip-compat-check`. This will disable all compatibility checks in LLT. Use this workaround only if correct model number, serial number etc. can't be restored.

#### Which RGB types are supported?

Currently only white-backlight and 4-zone RGB keyboards are supported.

#### Will iCue RGB keyboards be supported?

No. Check out [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/) project.

#### Will Legion Spectrum RGB keyboards be supported?

Probably. I would like to add support to Spectrum RGB, but I currently don't have a device that supports it. PRs are welcome.

#### Can I have more RGB effects?

Only options natively supported by hardware are available; adding support for custom effects is not planned. If you would like more customization check out [L5P-Keyboard-RGB](https://github.com/4JX/L5P-Keyboard-RGB) or [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/).

#### Can you add fan control to other models?

If you have a 2022 Legion that does not support it make a ticket and we'll try to add suport for it. Older models will not be supported due to technical limitations.

#### Why is my Fn lock is flipped?

Some devices experience this issue and frankly, I have no idea why. It is known issue, but if you know how to solve it, check out the Contribution section.

#### Why is switching to Performance mode seems buggy, when AI Engine is enabled?

It seems that some BIOS versions indeed have a weird issue when using Fn+Q. Only hope is to wait for Lenovo to fix it.

## How to collect logs?

In some cases it will be super useful if you can provide logs that this app can create. This helps with debugging and other issue solving.


To collect logs:

1. Make sure that Lenovo Legion Toolkit is not running (also gone from tray area).
2. Open `Run` (Win+R) and type there: `"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\LenovoLegionToolkit\Lenovo Legion Toolkit.exe" --trace` and hit OK
3. LLT will start and in the title bar you should see: `[LOGGING ENABLED]`
4. Reproduce the issue you have (i.e. try to use the option that causes issues)
5. Close LLT (also make sure it's gone from tray area)
6. Again, in `Run` (Win+R) type `"%LOCALAPPDATA%\LenovoLegionToolkit\log"`
7. You should see at least one file. Theses are the logs you should attach to the issue.


On version 2.6.0 or higher, you can also enable logs in a quicker way:

1. Make sure that Lenovo Legion Toolkit is not running (also gone from tray area).
2. Hold down Left Ctrl and Left Shift
3. Double click Lenovo Legion Toolkit icon
4. LLT will start and in the title bar you should see: `[LOGGING ENABLED]` you will also see an orange link to open the log file.


## Contribution

I appreciate any feedback that you have, so please do not hesitate to report issues.
Pull Requests are also welcome, but make sure to check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first!

#### Translation

Crowdin has been selected as the tool for handling translations. If you want to contribute, go to https://crowdin.com/project/llt and request access.

#### Bugs

If you find any bugs in the app, please report them. It will be very helpful if you attach logs that will help to trace the root cause of the issue. You can find logs in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\LenovoLegionToolkit\log`. Of course attach the latest log to the issue here on GitHub.

#### Compatibility

It would be great to expand the list of compatible devices, but to do it your help is needed!

If you are willing to check if this app works correctly on your device that is currently unsupported, click _Continue_ on the popup you saw on startup. Lenovo Legion Toolkit will start logging automatically so you can submit them if anything goes wrong.

*Remember that some functions may not function properly, so keep this in mind.*

I would appreciate it, if you create an issue here on GitHub with the results of your testing.

Make sure to include the following information in your issue:

1. Full model name (i.e. Legion 5 Pro 16ACH6H)
2. List of features that are working as expected.
3. List of features that seem to not work.
4. List of features that crash the app.

The more info you add, the better the app will get over time. If anything seems off, write down precisely what was wrong and attach logs (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\LenovoLegionToolkit\log`). 



Thanks in advance!
